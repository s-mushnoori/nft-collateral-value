# nft-collateral-value
Calculating the collateral value of NFT projects. The initial problem statement and data was part of an [interview question](https://metastreet.notion.site/Senior-Data-Scientist-Engineer-bad2e7e9a8e340d3a23ff77faa56548d) for Metastreet Labs. The same concept was applied to data for other NFT projects obtained from the [CharlieDAO](https://github.com/charliedao-eth/NterpriseFT/tree/main/data) GitHub Repo. 

The final result can be viewed on the live webapp [here](https://nftcvcalculator.herokuapp.com/). Note that the app may take a moment to load if it has been idle for a while.

## 1. Business Problem

The purpose of this project is to calculate the collateral value of an NFT from transaction data. An NFT is essentially a means to prove ownsership of a digital asset. And a digital asset, like any other asset, can be used as collateral to borrow money against. But how do we determine the collateral value of a volatile asset? Here's a formula that calculates the collateral's floor price:
